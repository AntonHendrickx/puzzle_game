# Puzzle game

This is a simple jigsaw puzzle game, coded in python and meant to be as flexible as possible

## Features:

- simple menu for image selection
- use your own images!
- many puzzle sizes 
- timer (that can be disabled)
- rotation setting for an extra challenge (still buggy!)
- save your progress
- different backgrounds
- And much more!

## WIP:
- different piece types (normal, square, hexagon,...) -> currenty only square and regular (also square for now!)
- sounds and music
- border piece filtering
- puzzle categories
